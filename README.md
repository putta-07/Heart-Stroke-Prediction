# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
This project aims to predict the risk of stroke using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a healthcare dataset to train and evaluate models for identifying individuals at high risk of stroke, enabling early intervention and preventive measures.

# Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early prediction and prevention are crucial for mitigating its impact. This project utilizes machine learning to develop models that can accurately predict stroke risk based on individual health and lifestyle factors.

# Dataset
The project utilizes the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" dataset, which contains information on various health and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking status, and more.

# Methodology
The project follows these steps:

Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand patterns and relationships in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features for model input.
Model Training: Training Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN models using the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Predicting stroke risk for new individuals based on their health and lifestyle data.

# Results
The models achieved promising results, with Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN demonstrating high accuracy (around 93.8%). The Decision Tree Classifier achieved a slightly lower accuracy (91.8%). The analysis also revealed interesting relationships between various factors and stroke risk, warranting further investigation.
